    <h2>Travelling in Depression</h2>
    <p style="padding:20px;">When I was little ,I caught the travel bug. it started after my grandparents first brought me to their home
       in france and i have now been to 29 different countries. Each had giving me a unique wroking experience
       <br>
       At five i <a href="https://www.starzit.com">marveled</a> at the Eiffel Tower in the city of light.
       When i was eight ,i stood in the heart of piazza san marco feeding hordes of pigeons  ,then glided down
       Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At 13 ,i saw the ancient,Megalithic structure of Stonehengeand 
       and <span style="float:left;">
        <img src="girl.jpeg" alt="girl" style="height:150px; margin: 10px; float: left;">
       </span> walked along the great wall of china,amazed that the thousand - years go stone was stay in place
       just as it is in ,<a href="https://www.starzit.com">Starz University</a>
       <br><br>
       it was through exploring cultures around the world that i first became interested in language.
       <br><br>
       It began with French ,which taught me the importance of pronunciation.I remember once asking a stone owner 
       in paris where Rue des praymideswas.but when I prounoced PYR-a- mides instead of pyr-A-mides ,with more 
       accent on the A,she look at me bewildered
       <br><br>
       In the eight grade , I Became fascenated with  spanish and aware of its similarities with English through
       congnate. Baseball in spanish, for example through cognates. different but sound nearly the same.
       this was incredible to me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today i find the 
       cognate come the rescure when i forget how to say something in spanish. <a href="mailto:horacekeziahj@gmail.com">send us email</a>
        
       
       <br><br>
       Then in high school, I developed enthusiasm for Chinese. as i studied chinese at my school, i marveled how if just one stroke 
       is missing form a charcter, the meaning is lost .I loved how words were formed combining simpler character, so Hou meaning 
       fire and shan meaning mountain can be joined to create Houshan, which means volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing 
       the characters and i can feel the beauty of the rhythm as i form them.
